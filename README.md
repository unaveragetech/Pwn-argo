# Multi-Agent File Processing System

This project is a multi-threaded, multi-agent file processing system designed to search through files for specific patterns, log the findings, and generate detailed reports. The system uses agents with unique configurations to process different types of data in parallel.

---

## **Features**
- **Multi-Agent System**: Supports multiple agents working simultaneously.
- **Customizable Search Patterns**: Define unique patterns for each agent using `example-agents.json`.
- **Threaded Execution**: Efficiently processes files in parallel.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time loading bars and detailed logs for each agent.
- **Report Generation**: Final reports summarizing each agentâ€™s activity and findings.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Set Up Input Files**
Place the files you want to process in the `input_files/` directory.

---

## **Usage**

### **1. Configure Agents**
Modify the `example-agents.json` file to define agents. Here's an example configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "EmailFinder",
    "search_pattern": "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}",
    "file_limit": 5
  },
  {
    "name": "UsernameFinder",
    "search_pattern": "\\buser[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\\b",
    "file_limit": 5
  }
]
```

### **2. Run the Script**
Run the `main.py` file to start the system:
```bash
python main.py
```

### **3. Check Outputs**
Processed results will be saved in the `output/` directory. Each agent will have its own folder with:
- `results.json`: Matches found for the specified pattern.
- `logs.txt`: Logs detailing the agent's activities.
- `final_report.txt`: A summary report of the agent's performance.

## **Example Use Case**
1. **EmailFinder**: Searches for email addresses in files.
2. **UsernameFinder**: Identifies usernames starting with "user".

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add more agents for different data patterns.
- Implement a GUI for configuring and monitoring agents.
- Optimize for large datasets.
